My interest in programming arose during my master's degree studies, during which weâ€™ve learned the basics of programming in Phyton.
I used the knowledge I acquired there when writing my master's thesis. After graduating, my professional path changed, but my passion for
exploring topics related to programming remained. Iâ€™ve decided to spend my free time educating myself in this area so that I could connect my professional future
with working in IT. Currently, I am at the beginning of this path, but itâ€™s important to me to have a job which will let me to further develop my skills and expand my knowledge.
